# The Towerfall Drinking Game

Every game is better with a drinking game. Here are the rules my group of friends uses for Towerfall.

## The setup 
Headhunters, first to ten

## Each Round
* The King must drink, and is responsible for advancing to the next round
* If anyone advances to the next round that isn't the King, they must drink
* Anyone 3 kills or more behind the king must drink
  * just one drink no matter how many behind
* Any two players who clink arrows during the match must clink glasses and drink 
  * one drink per clink
* If you are killed by a player who has no arrows, you must drink
  * This doesn't include if someone shot you with their last arrow.
* If you're the last person alive and didn't kill anyone, you must drink
* If you kill all other players, everyone else must drink.
* evaluate any Match Winner rules (see below)

## After each match
The Match winner is allowed to create a rule that only applies to the next Match. Usually these are not drinking rules, but rules that add silliness. 

### Some Examples
* Anyone five kills or more behind must start play by doing 3 air squats
* Anyone five kills or more behind must play from the kitchen
* Anyone five kills or more behind must wear a collander on their head
