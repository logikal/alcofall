# The Towerfall Drinking Game

Every game is better with a drinking game. Here are the rules my group of friends uses for Towerfall.

## The setup 
Headhunters, first to ten

## Each Round

### It's good to be the king
The King(s) must drink, and is responsible for advancing to the next round

### We Three Kings
If there are 3 kings, they all must drink 3 times.

### The Asshole
If anyone advances to the next round that isn't the King, they must drink

### The Slowpoke
Anyone 3 kills or more behind the king must drink
 > just one drink no matter how many behind

### Cheers
Any two players who clink arrows during the match must clink glasses and drink 
 > one drink per clink 

### The Mushroom Kingdom
If you are killed by a player who has no arrows, you must drink
 > This doesn't include if someone shot you with their last arrow.

### The Sole Survivor
If you're the last person alive and didn't kill anyone, you must drink

### The Ace
If you kill all other players, everyone else must drink.

### Everything Else
Evaluate any Match Winner rules (see below)

## After each match
The Match winner is allowed to create a rule that only applies to the next Match. Usually these are not drinking rules, but rules that add silliness. 

### Some Match Rule Examples
* Anyone five kills or more behind must start play by doing 3 air squats
* Anyone five kills or more behind must play from the kitchen
* Anyone five kills or more behind must wear a collander on their head
