Here are the rules my group of friends uses for Towerfall.\r\n\r\n## The setup \r\nHeadhunters, first to ten\r\n\r\n## Each Round\r\n\r\n### It's good to be the king\r\nThe King(s) must drink, and is responsible for advancing to the next round\r\n\r\n### We Three Kings\r\nIf there are 3 kings, they all must drink 3 times.\r\n\r\n### The Asshole\r\nIf anyone advances to the next round that isn't the King, they must drink\r\n\r\n### The Slowpoke\r\nAnyone 3 kills or more behind the king must drink\r\n* just one drink no matter how many behind\r\n\r\n### Cheers\r\nAny two players who clink arrows during the match must clink glasses and drink \r\n* one drink per clink \r\n\r\n### The Mushroom Kingdom\r\nIf you are killed by a player who has no arrows, you must drink\r\n * This doesn't include if someone shot you with their last arrow.\r\n\r\n### The Sole Survivor\r\nIf you're the last person alive and didn't kill anyone, you must drink\r\n\r\n### The Ace\r\nIf you kill all other players, everyone else must drink.\r\n\r\n### Everything Else\r\nEvaluate any Match Winner rules (see below)\r\n\r\n## After each match\r\nThe Match winner is allowed to create a rule that only applies to the next Match. Usually these are not drinking rules, but rules that add silliness. \r\n\r\n### Some Match Rule Examples\r\n* Anyone five kills or more behind must start play by doing 3 air squats\r\n* Anyone five kills or more behind must play from the kitchen\r\n* Anyone five kills or more behind must wear a collander on their head\r\n\r\n\r\n## gif examples!\r\n\r\n### The Mushroom Kingdom\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AoYOYRL.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMany thanks to @siyegen, @partkyle, @eddiezane, and @yrck for help tuning this drinking game.\r\n","google":"UA-54336484-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
